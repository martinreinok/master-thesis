Timestamp,Your experience with endovasclar procedures,The control system was precise,The presence of haptic feedback was helpful in completing the task.,The guidewire detection software felt stable and predictable.,Guidewire tracking with MR slice movement was helpful.,"I felt stressed, irritated or annoyed while using this system during the task.",It was easy to control/use the system. ,It was easy to make mistakes with the system. ,Staying focused on what I was doing was easy. ,The system was safe to use. ,I would like to use the system again for this kind of task. ,I would recommend this system to a colleague. ,Any comments for further improvement (optional)
